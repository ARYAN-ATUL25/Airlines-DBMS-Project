# YodaAirlines
Analyzing, designing and implementing a DBMS for a real data of an Airline Reservation System that users can book their flights online for their travels. There are five phases in this concept of the project specification.

# Phase I - Requirement Analysis and Specification Report 
# Phase II – ER Diagram Report
# Phase III - Database Design Report
  Convert your conceptual schema into a logical model that can be implemented in a relational DBMS. Convert the ER diagram to a database design. Document your design in Database Schema format. Use appropriate naming conventions for all of your tables and attributes. Indicate the relationships and keys of the tables in the diagram.
# Phase IV – First Implementation Control & Updated DB: Write SQL statements to create database, tables on selected process and publish these data on web part. 
  Write SQL statements to create the database and tables (primary key and foreign keys etc.) and all other structures related to your database. Design and implement application interfaces to realize required database operations(select,update,delete and add) on the website. Implement your project on the multi-tier architecture.
# Phase V – Final Report, Project Submission & Control: Create database and complete all database operations. Design and implement interfaces to realize all database operations of your project. 
  Design and implement interfaces to realize all of your database operations. Implement your project depends on the multi-tier architecture. Test all web interfaces to realize all database operations. Database operations should be realized on stored procedures, and trigger and view also should be used. Use session and create admin pages which controls the all information on the database. Logs should be stored and display logs on admin page.
